This is where I keep all my SolarWinds related code that is fit to be seen by the world. For the last few years I had been working as a consultant so a lot of this stuff was kept relatively low key since it was my bread and butter, but I am no longer in that game so I'll be cleaning up some of my collection and releasing it into the wild for the benefit of overburdened SW admins everywhere.

Feel free to contribute if you see any places where improvements should be made.
