This will serve as the home of the views and widgets I want to share out with other Thwack users.  Attributions and links for anything I don't make myself are going to be in the initial commits, so check the history if you want to know where things came from.

The folders directly inside this path all represent Viewgroups, with the obvious exception of the NoViewGroup section, as those are single page views.


The importer tools are pretty flexible in that you can add and remove the widget XML files from a view if you want to modify anything, so if you don't like or need one of the resources you can just delete it from the folder before importing, or you can copy in widgets from another view.  It will try to place itself at the same column and position as it was in the original view so you might have to shuffle things around if you get into hacking them up that way, or you can just edit the XML directly to bring about your desired changes, but be careful that you don't break the XML syntax or try to give your resources impossible properties.

I'm hoping this can be a community resource we can all really take advantage of to streamline one of the most commonly asked about aspects of the Orion platform, dashboards and view customization.
