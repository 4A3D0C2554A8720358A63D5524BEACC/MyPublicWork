Files sent over by wluther

This is the main view, which has a little JS box to help navigate through all my view groups. Once you click on one of those view groups on the left side...
It should populate all the tabs, and as well as links, for you to jump to.

2nd tab should just be a SWQL query widget to list which files/options are being used on a view.

The other 3 tabs have been "Work In Progress" for a long time, and will likely never see their time to shine. I left them in case someone else wanted to see how to not do something.
